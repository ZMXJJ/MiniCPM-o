The "MiniCPM" series of edge-side large models, is a lightweight, high-performance edge-side large model jointly developed by ModelBest, the OpenBMB open-source community, and the Tsinghua NLP Lab. This series includes the base model MiniCPM and multimodal models MiniCPM-V / MiniCPM-o, and is renowned globally for its characteristics of achieving strong performance despite its small size, along with high efficiency and low cost.

Currently, it has ushered in the "Edge-side ChatGPT Moment" in terms of performance. In the field of multimodal capabilities, it has comprehensively reached a level comparable to GPT-4o, achieving real-time understanding of video and multiple images together on edge devices for the first time.

At present, MiniCPM is being deployed across various smart terminal scenarios, including smartphones, computers, automobiles, wearable devices, and VR equipment. For more detailed information about the MiniCPM series of models, please visit the OpenBMB webpage.
