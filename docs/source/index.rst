**MiniCPM-V / MiniCPM-o** is a lightweight, high-performance edge-side large multimodal model jointly developed by ModelBest, the OpenBMB, and the Tsinghua NLP Lab. Both multimodal models are pretrained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets, and subsequently fine-tuned on high-quality data to align with human preferences.
MiniCPM can perform natural language understanding, text generation, visual comprehension, tool utilization, role-playing, and function as an AI agent, among other capabilities.

The latest version, MiniCPM-V 4.0,  includes the following key features:

.. rubric:: 🎯 **GPT-4V Level Performance**

- Surpasses GPT-4V in single-image, multi-image, and video understanding
- Advanced multimodal reasoning capabilities
- Real-time video understanding on iPad

.. rubric:: 📱 **Edge-Friendly & Efficient**

- Only 4B parameters of pure AI magic
- Smooth and fast inference on iPad
- Efficient memory usage (~3GB RAM)
- **Nature Published** – Research in prestigious `Nature Communications <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61040-5>`__!

.. rubric:: 🌍 **Multilingual & Creative**
